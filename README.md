# Technical assessment

## Short description
You work at a parcel delivery company and you are asked to design a system to automate the internal handling of parcels coming in. 
The parcels are coming in at the distribution center and need to be handled by different departments based on their weight and value.
Currently management is making plans that could lead to the adding or removal of departments in the future.

## Features

### Feature 1
The current business rules are as follows:
- Parcels with a weight up to 1 kg are handled by the "Mail" departement.
- Parcels with a weight up to 10 kg are handled by the "Regular" department.
- Parcels with a weight over 10 kg are handled by the "Heavy" department.

### Feature 2
Parcels with a value of over â‚¬ 1000,- need to be signed off by the "Insurance" department, before being processed by the other departments.

### Feature 3 (optional)
The company has decided to productize the software and sell it under a license subscription model. The business rules will vary per customer and need to be configurable.

## Excercise
- Parse the XML file (Container_68465468.xml)
- Build a working application using a language and frameworks of your chooksing, unless otherwise agreed upon
- Unit tests
- Presentation (maybe some UI / Console app)

## During the technical interview
- Demonstrate the behavior of the code.
- Show us how adding or removing a department would be done.
